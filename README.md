#Review assignments on your tablet

##Before sitting the exam

1. Create a new examination on the main window
2. Create a new examination issue by giving the date of the examination
3. Attach a csv file containing the student list to the examination issue
(`Import students`).
4. Attach a pdf file containing the exercises (1 page per exercise, leave ample
space on top of page) (`Set document`)
5. Run `Make copies` to generate the exam sheets.

##After the sitting

6. Scan all pages and save to pdf
7. Upload the pdf to your tablet. Use your favorite app to annotate the
exercices, adding a text annotation on top of the datamatrix containing the
marking (numerical from 0 to 10) and nothing else.
7. Run `Tag annotations` to generate a copy of this indexed by student name.
8. Run `Markings` to obtain a csv file with all the markings.
